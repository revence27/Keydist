#   This here should find a kind of Levenshtein distance for words, but it is
#   based, as is my habit, on the layout of the keyboard, rather than being a
#   na√Øve implementation.
#   It is not generalised. This time, it is strictly for the phone.

#   It creates String#-, which _is_ commutative, unlike the traditional -.
#   So, 'man' - 'boy' = 'boy' - 'man'

#   Now: 'man' - 'men' = 2, and 'man' - 'mbn' = 1, which makes 'mbn' have a
#   smaller distance from 'man', because they share a key on the phone (it could
#   be a case of one pressing the key one time too many). However,
#   'man' - 'med' = 4, which places 'men' closer to 'man', in case of bad
#   spelling, than 'med'.
#   'man' - 'man' = 0, for there is no distance between the same two words.

#   An arbitrary/heuristic way to decide, sans interaction, which of the words
#   in a list were intended, if all of them were missed, is to take the one that
#   is closest, of those that are within < 3 in distance. If you get only one,
#   use that.

#   The - operator has an unspecified time complexity that is huge.
#   It is at least O(5n*n^2) on the shortest string.
#   Please use only with short strings, and sparingly. It has not been optimised
#   for speed, just for the comfort of those who may have made the spelling
#   errors (not even for the programmer).

#   TODO:
#   1.  Add accented characters to the keypad, when I get a text editor that
#       permits it.
